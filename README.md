# Minecraft AFK Fishing Script (for Linux)

License: Unlicense (https://unlicense.org/)

A simple shell script to use for AFK ('away from keyboard') fishing in the [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) video game. When executed with an instance of the game running, it simulates the action of holding down the right mouse button, a.k.a. the standard 'use' button in the game. This is ideal for when you have an [automatic fishing farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTAHK2XnpQs) set up and you want to leave your in-game character to just...go at it for a bit while you go do something else in real life.

Requires [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool) to run. Remember to mark the file as executable.

## Instructions

Download the file `fishing`, mark it as executable with `chmod 775 ./fishing` or `chmod +x fishing`, and then run it with `./fishing`. This script is best suited to be placed in any location within your operating system's `$PATH` variable so you can run it from any location within the terminal.

In Minecraft, make sure your in-game character is properly positioned, i.e. the cursor is on the note block.
